# Austin-highest-earning-majors
The Class of 2023 has graduated. This is the first graduating class after the complete end of the pandemic. I hope to showcase the new characteristics of the job market for young people through this story. In the chart section, I analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard to examine the highest-paying bachelor's degrees in the Austin area.

The idea for the chart was inspired by Ryan Serpico, who analyzed the situation in the Houston and San Antonio areas for the San Antonio Express-News. You can find his analysis here(https://github.com/ryan-serpico/tx-college-grad-earnings).

## Data Overview

To analyze the highest earning majors, I used two datasets. The first dataset is from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard. I used the "College_coordinates.csv" to find the colleges and universities in Austin. The second dataset, "Most-Recent-Cohorts-Field-of-Study.parquet," helped me identify all the majors associated with the colleges in Austin.

The median income figures are based on students who graduated during the award years 2014-15 and 2015-16 and who accepted federal aid during their studies. The scorecard utilizes administrative tax records maintained by the IRS within the Department of the Treasury.

In Austin, there are 26 educational organizations. However, in this story, we will only focus on the analysis of bachelor's degrees. Therefore, we will only consider The University of Texas at Austin, Saint Edward's University, and Concordia University Texas.
